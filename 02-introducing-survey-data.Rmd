# Overview of Surveys {#c02}

Creating and fielding surveys to provide estimates of a population are much more complex than simply adding a few questions to an online platform.  Survey researchers can spend months or even years developing the study design, questions, and other methods for a single survey to ensure high quality data is collected.  While this book focuses on the analysis methods of surveys, understanding the entire survey process can provide us with a better understanding of what types of analyses should be conducted on the data.  There are many pieces of existing literature that cover designing and implementing surveys that we recommend reviewing in detail (e.g., {cite: Dillman book, Groves book, education book?, others?}).  The information provided in this chapter is a brief introduction into the survey process to provide a foundation of the complexities and nuances of survey data. 

## Survey Process
The survey life cycle starts with a research topic or question of interest.  For example, a researcher may be interested in the impact childhood trauma has on political affiliation later in life. Before choosing to conduct a survey, researchers typically review existing data to determine if data is already available that can answer this question.  If existing data cannot answer the nuances of this research question, a survey can be used to capture the exact data that the researcher needs.

Let's assume that our researcher needs to create a survey to capture this data.  They would first need to think through a study design.  In other words, the researcher needs a plan for who they are going to survey and how they are going to survey them.  Once the study design is in place, the research can move forward with the survey process.  Figure \@ref(fig:svylifecycle) shows a high level view of the survey process.

### Study Design

Having a robust study design is crucial for success of the survey both implementation and analysis.  Knowing who and how to survey individuals depends on both the goals of the study and the feasibility of implementation.  Who we want to survey is known as the population of interest in the study.  This could be broad, such as, "all adults age 18+ living in the U.S.", or it could be a very specific population of interest based on a specific characteristic or location.  For example, we may want to know about "adults age 18-24 who live in Texas" or "eligible U.S. voters living in Pennsylvania".  

While it would be great to survey every person that meet these requirements (i.e., conduct a census), the ability to implement a questionnaire at that scale is something few can do.  Instead, researchers choose to sample individuals and use weights to estimate numbers in the population.  There are a variety of different sampling methods that can be used, and more information on these can be found in Chapter \@ref(c05).

Once a population of interest is identified, researchers need to consider how to survey these individuals.  For example, if we plan to survey adults age 18-24, asking them to complete a survey over the phone would most likely be not very successful since that age group does less direct phone communication than older groups.  Understanding the unique aspects of the population will provide insight into how they can best be reached and engaged.

There are four main modes that researchers consider when conducting a survey:

* Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI; also known as face-to-face or in-person interviewing)
* Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI; also known as phone or telephone interviewing)
* Web 
* Paper and Pencil

Researchers can use a single mode to collect data, or multiple modes (also called mixed modes).  Using mixed modes can allow for broader reach and can increase response rates depending on the population of interest ({CITE DeLeeuw mixed mode article}).

Additionally, hard to reach populations (e.g., people belonging to specific minority population) or surveys with sensitive topics may take longer to develop than a survey of college students at a specific university.

### Questionnaire Design

Returning to our example research question of "Trauma" could have many different meanings to each survey respondent, so asking a generic question of "Have you ever experienced trauma?" may not be helpful from a research and analysis perspective.  Instead, the researcher may want to
