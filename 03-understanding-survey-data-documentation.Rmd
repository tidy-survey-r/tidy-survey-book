## Introduction

Before diving into survey analysis, it's crucial to review the survey documentation thoroughly. The documentation includes technical guides, questionnaires, codebooks, errata, and other useful resources. By taking the time to review these materials, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the survey data (including research and design decisions discussed in Chapters \@ref(c02-overview-surveys) and \@ref(c10-specifying-sample-designs)) and effectively conduct our analysis. 

Survey documentation can vary in organization, type, and ease of use. The information may be stored in any format - PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, etc. Some surveys save different documentation together, such as providing a single document containing both the codebook and the questionnaire. Others keep them in separate files. Despite these differences, it is important to know what kind of information is available in each documentation type and what to focus on in each one.

## Types of Survey Documentation

### Technical Documentation
The technical documentation, also known as user guides or methodology/analysis guides, highlights the variables necessary to specify the survey design. We recommend focusing on these key sections:

  * **Introduction:** The introduction orients us to the survey. This section provides the project's background, the study's purpose, and the main research questions.
  * **Study design:** The study design section describes how researchers prepared and administered the survey.
  * **Sample:** The sample section describes how researchers selected cases, any sampling error that occurred, and the limitations of the sample. This section can contain recommendations on how to use sampling weights. Look for weight information, whether the survey design contains strata, clusters/PSUs, or replicate weights. Also look for population sizes, finite population correction, or replicate weight scaling information. The sample documentation is critical in successfully running our analysis, and more detail on sample designs is available in Chapter \@ref(c10-specifying-sample-designs).

The technical documentation may include other helpful information. Some technical documentation includes syntax for SAS, SUDAAN, Stata, and/or R, meaning we do not have to create this code from scratch.

### Questionnaires

A questionnaire is a series of questions used to collect information from people in a survey. It can ask about opinions, behaviors, demographics, or even just numbers like the count of lightbulbs, square footage, or farm size. Questionnaires can employ different types of questions, such as closed-ended (e.g., select one or check all that apply), open-ended (e.g., numeric or text), Likert scales, or ranking questions. It may randomize the display order of responses or include instructions to help respondents understand the questions. A survey may have one questionnaire or multiple, depending on its scale and scope.

The questionnaire is another essential resource for understanding and interpreting the survey data (see Section \@ref(overview-design-questionnaire)), and we should use it alongside any analysis. It provides details about each of the questions asked in the survey, such as question name, question wording, response options, skip logic, randomizations, display specification, mode differences, and the universe (if only a subset of respondents were asked the question).

Below, in Figure \@ref(fig:understand-que-examp), we show a question from the ANES 2020 questionnaire [@anes-svy]. This figure shows a particular question's question name (`POSTVOTE_RVOTE`), description (Did R Vote?), full wording of the question and responses, response order, universe, question logic (if `vote_pre` = 0), and other specifications. The section also includes the variable name, which we can link to the codebook.

```{r}
#| label: understand-que-examp
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: ANES 2020 Questionnaire Example
#| fig.alt: Question information about the variable postvote_rvote from ANES 2020 questionnaire Survey question, Universe, Logic, Web Spec, Response Order, and Released Variable are included. 

knitr::include_graphics(path="images/questionnaire-example.jpg")
```

The content and structure of questionnaires vary depending on the specific survey. For instance, question names may be informative (like the ANES example), sequential, or denoted by a code.  In some cases, surveys may not use separate names for questions and variables. Figure \@ref(fig:understand-que-examp-2) shows a question from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire that shows a sequential question number and a coded variable name (as opposed to a question name) [@brfss-svy].

```{r}
#| label: understand-que-examp-2
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: BRFSS 2021 Questionnaire Example
#| fig.alt: Question information about the variable BPHIGH6 from BRFSS 2021 questionnaire. Question number, question text, variable names, responses, skip info and CATI note, interviewer notes, and columns are included. 

knitr::include_graphics(path="images/questionnaire-example-2.jpg")
```

Given the variety in how the survey information is presented in documentation, we need to consider the details of a survey when running our analyses.  For example, surveys that use different modes (e.g., web and mail) may have different question wording or skip logic, as a web survey can include fills or automate skip logic. This may result in separate scripts for each mode.  Reviewing the questionnaire documentation for the specific survey is crucial in understanding how to interpret the data and findings.

### Codebooks

While a questionnaire provides information about the questions asked to respondents, the codebook explains how the survey data was coded and recorded. The codebook lists details such as variable names, variable labels, variable meanings, codes for missing data, value labels, and value types (whether categorical or continuous, etc.). In particular, the codebook (as opposed to the questionnaire) often includes information on missing data. The codebook enables us to understand and use the variables appropriately in our analysis. Note that some studies use the terminology *data dictionary* rather than codebook.

Figure \@ref(fig:understand-codebook-examp) is a question from the ANES 2020 codebook [@anes-cb]. This part indicates a particular variable's name (`V202066`), question wording, value labels, universe, and associated survey question (`POSTVOTE_RVOTE`).

```{r}
#| label: understand-codebook-examp
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: ANES 2020 Codebook Example
#| fig.alt: Variable information about the variable V202066 from ANES 2020 questionnaire Variable meaning, Value labels, Universe, and Survey Question(s) are included. 

knitr::include_graphics(path="images/codebook-example.jpg")
```

Reviewing both questionnaires and codebooks in parallel is important (Figures \@ref(fig:understand-que-examp) and \@ref(fig:understand-codebook-examp)), as questions and variables do not always correspond directly to each other in a one-to-one mapping. A single question may have multiple associated variables, or a single variable may summarize multiple questions. Reviewing the codebook clarifies how to interpret the variables. 

### Errata

An erratum (singular) or errata (plural) is a document that lists errors found in a publication or dataset, such as a survey questionnaire. The purpose of an erratum is to correct or update mistakes or inaccuracies in the original document.

For example, if a survey questionnaire contains an error, such as a typo or confusing wording, the researchers would release an erratum that provides a corrected version. Another type of erratum is amending incorrectly programmed skips in an electronic survey where questions are skipped by the respondent when they should not have been. Review these errata before conducting any analysis to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the survey data and analysis.

### Additional Resources

Surveys may have additional resources, such as interviewer instructions or "show cards" provided to respondents during interviewer-administered surveys to help respondents answer questions. Explore the survey website to find out what resources were used and in what contexts.

## Missing data coding

For some observations in a dataset, there may be missing data. This can be by design or from nonresponse, and these concepts are detailed in Chapter \@ref(c11-missing-data). In that chapter, we also discuss how to analyze data with missing data. In this section, we discuss how to understand documentation related to missing data.

The survey documentation, often the codebook, represents the missing data with a code. The codebook may list different codes depending on why certain data is missing. In the example of variable `V202066` from the ANES (Figure \@ref(fig:understand-codebook-examp)), `-9` represents "Refused," `-7` means that the response was deleted due to an incomplete interview, `-6` means that there is no response because there was no follow-up interview, and `-1` means "Inapplicable" (due to the designed skip pattern). 

As another example, there may be a summary variable that describes the missingness of a set of variables - particularly with "select all that apply" or "multiple response" questions. In the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), respondents who are victims of a crime and saw the offender are asked if the offender have a weapon and then asked what the type of weapon was. This part of the questionnaire from 2021 is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:understand-ncvs-weapon-q).

```{r}
#| label: understand-ncvs-weapon-q
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: Excerpt from the NCVS 2020-2021 Crime Incident Report - Weapon Type
#| fig.alt: Questions 22 and 23a from the NCVS 2020-2021 Crime Incident Report, see https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ncvs20_cir.pdf 

knitr::include_graphics(path="images/questionnaire-ncvs-weapon.jpg")
```

<!-- https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ncvs20_cir.pdf -->

The NCVS codebook includes coding for all multiple response variables of a "lead in" variable that summarizes the individual options. For question 23a on the weapon type, the lead in variable is V4050 which is shown in \@ref(fig:understand-ncvs-weapon-cb). This variable is then followed by a set of variables for each weapon type. An example of one of the individual variables from the codebook, the handgun, is shown in \@ref(fig:understand-ncvs-weapon-cb-hg). We will dive in more to this example in Chapter \@ref(c11-missing-data) of how to analyze this variable.

```{r}
#| label: understand-ncvs-weapon-cb
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: Excerpt from the NCVS 2021 Codebook for V4050 - LI WHAT WAS WEAPON
#| fig.alt: Codebook includes location of variable (files and columns), variable type (numeric), question (What was the weapon? Anything else?), and the coding of this lead in variable
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/codebook-ncvs-weapon-li.jpg")
```


```{r}
#| label: understand-ncvs-weapon-cb-hg
#| echo: false
#| fig.cap: "Excerpt from the NCVS 2021 Codebook for V4051 - C WEAPON: HAND GUN"
#| fig.alt: Codebook includes location of variable (files and columns), variable type (numeric), question (What was the weapon? Anything else?), and the coding of this categorical variable
knitr::include_graphics(path="images/codebook-ncvs-weapon-handgun.jpg")
```

When data is read into R, some values may be system missing, that is they are coded as `NA` even if that is not evident in a codebook. We will discuss in Chapter \@ref(c11-missing-data) how to analyze data with `NA` values and review how R handles missing data in calculations.

## Example: American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020 Survey Documentation 

Let's look at the survey documentation for the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. The survey website is located at [https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-time-series-study/](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2020-time-series-study/).  

Navigating to "User Guide and Codebook" [@anes-cb], we can download the PDF that contains the survey documentation, titled "ANES 2020 Time Series Study Full Release: User Guide and Codebook". Do not be daunted by the 796-page PDF. We can focus on the most critical information.

#### Introduction {-}

The first section in the User Guide explains that the ANES 2020 Times Series Study continues a series of election surveys conducted since 1948. These surveys contain data on public opinion and voting behavior in the U.S. presidential elections. The introduction also includes information about the modes used for data collection (web, live video interviewing, or CATI). Additionally, there is a summary of the number of pre-election interviews (8,280) and post-election re-interviews (7,449).

#### Sample Design and Respondent Recruitment {-}

The section "Sample Design and Respondent Recruitment" provides more detail about how the survey was conducted in that it was a sequential mixed-mode design.  This means that all three modes were conducted one after another and not at the same time.  Additionally, it indicates that for the 2020 survey, they resampled all respondents who participated in 2016 ANES, along with a freshly-drawn cross-section:

> The target population for the fresh cross-section was the 231 million non-institutional U.S. citizens aged 18 or older living in the 50 U.S. states or the District of Columbia.

The document continues with more details on the sample groups.

#### Data Analysis, Weights, and Variance Estimation {-}

The section "Data Analysis, Weights, and Variance Estimation" includes information on weights and strata/cluster variables. Reading through, we can find the full sample weight variables:

> For analysis of the complete set of cases using pre-election data only, including all cases and representative of the 2020 electorate, use the full sample pre-election weight, **V200010a**. For analysis including post-election data for the complete set of participants (i.e., analysis of post-election data only or a combination of pre- and post-election data), use the full sample post-election weight, **V200010b**. Additional weights are provided for analysis of subsets of the data...

The document provides more information about the variables, summarized in Table \@ref(tab:aneswgts).

Table: (\#tab:aneswgts) Weight and variance information for ANES

For weight | Use variance unit/PSU/cluster | and use variance stratum
:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:
V200010a| V200010c| V200010d
V200010b| V200010c| V200010d

The user guide references a supplemental document called "How to Analyze ANES Survey Data" [@debell] as a 'how-to guide' to help us with our analysis. In the how-to guide, we learn more about the weights, including that the weights sum to the sample size and not the population. If we want to create estimates at the population level instead of the sample level, we will need to adjust the weights to the population.  Let's recall the "Sample Design and Respondent Recruitment" section:

> The target population for the fresh cross-section was the 231 million non-institutional U.S. citizens aged 18 or older living in the 50 U.S. states or the District of Columbia.

To create accurate weights for the population, we need to determine the total population size when the survey was conducted. This can be determined using the Current Population Survey (CPS) for March of 2020 as stated in the ANES documentation. Chapter \@ref(c04-set-up) goes into more detail about how to calculate this value and adjust the data.

## Searching for Public-Use Survey Data 
Throughout this book, we use public-use datasets from different surveys.  Above, we provided an example from the American National Election Survey (ANES), and we will continue to use this dataset throughout the book.  Additionally, we use the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), and the AmericasBarometer surveys.  
As mentioned in Chapter \@ref(c02-overview-surveys), instead of creating a new survey, researchers should look for existing data that can provide insights into their research questions. One of the greatest sources of data is the government. For example, in the U.S., we can get data directly from the various statistical agencies like we have done with RECS and NCVS.  Other countries often have data available through official statistics offices, such as the Office for National Statistics in the U.K. 

In addition to government data, many researchers will make their data publicly available through repositories such as the [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) variable search](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/ssvd/) or the [Odum Institute Data Archive](https://odum.unc.edu/archive/). Searching these repositories or other compiled lists (e.g., [Analyze Survey Data for Free - asdfree.com](https://asdfree.com)) can be an efficient way to identify surveys with questions related to the researcher's topic of interest.
