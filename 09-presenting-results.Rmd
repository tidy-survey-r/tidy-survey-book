# Communicating Results {#c09}

One of the most important aspects of data analysis is how to communicate the results to others.  This could include other researchers who are familiar with your survey data or other people who will be seeing this data and results for the first time.  Ensuring that you are accurately discussing the methodology, analysis, and displaying results is crucial to making sure your audience comprehends what the results are saying.  There have been jokes made about how you can lie with statistics, so it is our responsibility to discuss and present the results carefully.
